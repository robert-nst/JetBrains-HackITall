## Overview

**Program on the Go** is an IntelliJ plugin that creates an embedded server every time a new IDE instance is launched. When the server is running, the plugin displays a public URL (generated via **ngrok**) and a corresponding QR code in the side toolbar.

Using our dedicated Flutter mobile app, you can scan the QR code to trigger remote builds. If a build fails, the plugin utilizes the **OpenAI API** to analyze the error output, provide a simplified explanation, and generate a potential solution. The plugin can then automatically apply code modifications and allows you to rerun the build cycle until a successful build is achieved.

This plugin was developed for the **HackITall II Hackathon** with the main sponsorship of **JetBrains**.

## Features

- **Embedded Server:** Automatically starts an embedded server when a new IntelliJ instance opens.
- **Public URL & QR Code:** Generates a public URL (using ngrok) and a matching QR code in the IDE's side toolbar.
- **Remote Build via Flutter Mobile App:** Scan the QR code with our Flutter app to build applications remotely.
- **Build Suggestions:** If a build fails, the plugin uses the OpenAI API to provide simple error explanations and generate possible code fixes.
- **Automatic Code Modification:** Applies the generated fixes directly in your code, with an option to rerun the build.

## How It Works

1. **Server Initialization:** Upon opening a new IntelliJ instance, the plugin launches an embedded server.
2. **URL & QR Code Generation:** Once the server is up, a public URL is created using ngrok and displayed in the side toolbar, along with its QR code.
3. **Remote Build Trigger:** The Flutter mobile app scans the QR code and connects to the server to initiate a remote build.
4. **Error Handling & Suggestions:** If the build fails, the plugin calls the OpenAI API to analyze the error, displaying a simple error message and suggesting a potential solution.
5. **Code Modification & Rerun:** The suggested code changes can be applied automatically, and you can rerun the build cycle until the build succeeds.

## Running the Plugin

To run the plugin, you can use the provided Gradle run configuration. For example, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
./gradlew runIde
```

This will launch a new instance of IntelliJ with the plugin enabled.
> You can just run the plugin form the Intellij IDEA IDE, using the integrated Gradle configurations (using the main run button or using the side panel).

## Running the Flutter Mobile App

To run the Flutter mobile app, execute the following commands:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
flutter run
```

These commands will set up the app assets and launch the mobile application.
